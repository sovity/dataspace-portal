# Provision your CaaS

To leverage the maximum benefits of the DSPortal, as a user belonging to a Participant Organization you are encouraged to make as many Data Offers as possible available to other Participant Organizations. On this page, we explain to you how to make the Data Offers of your organization visible to other Participant Organizations.

1. On the "My Connectors" page, click on the "Add Connector" button

3. On the next page that appears, you can select between 2 options:
    - **I have a connector**: Use if you want to connect an existing - your own - CaaS (connector-as-a-service) with the DSPortal.
    - **I need a connector**: Use if you want to setup a fresh new CaaS.
