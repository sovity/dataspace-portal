{% hint style="info" %} We recommend that you encourage invitees to activate their accounts within the timebox for which the invitation link is enabled. For security reasons, the default timebox for the invitation link is 12 hours. We plan to increase this limit in the future. {% endhint %}

When clicking the invitation link, the user will be asked to set a password for their account and to set up two-factor authentication.
