Organization management is only available to Authority Admins and Authority Users. If you have one of these application roles you can see the Authority section on the navigation bar.

On the Organization page you can see all organizations registered in the Data Space Portal. They can be filtered by their Status:

- _Invited_: Organization invitation has been sent, but was not yet accepted
- _Onboarding_: The Admin of an invited organization has already logged-in at least once and needs to fill in organization details
- _Pending_: Organization has sent a registration request
- _Rejected_: Organization registration request has been rejected

Click in the row of an organization to view the organization details. Quickly switch between two organization detail pages by using the arrows at the top left of the details view.
