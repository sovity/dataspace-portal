# Provide Data Offers

To leverage the maximum benefits of the DSPortal, as a user belonging to a Participant Organization you are encouraged to make as many Data Offers as possible available to other Participant Organizations. On this page, we explain to you how to make the Data Offers of your organization visible to other Participant Organizations.

1. To provision Data Offers, please read the documentation [HERE](https://edc.docs.sovity.de/frontend/providing/create-data-offer).

   **Important:** Please snsure that you make Data Offers publicly available by using the "always-true" policy. This will ensure that the data offer appears on the Data Catalog of the DSPortal for other participants.
   

2. To check that your Data Offer is visible to other participants of the DSPortal, please check the Data Catalog page.

   {% hint style="info" %} It may take up to 5 minutes for the Data Offer to appear on the Data Catalog page due systems configurations reasons. {% endhint %}
