# Administration of Participating Organizations

## Profile Management

A user can see their profile by clicking on their name in the top right corner and then "My Profile".

Any user is able to edit their own information by maneuvering to his own profile and clicking "Edit".
First name, last name, job title, email and phone number can be updated and changes persisted by clicking "Update".

## Organization Roles
Also, a user can see the Organization Roles assigned to him/her by clicking on the Tab "Users and Roles".
As a participant in the Data Space Portal, you can have one of the following Organization Roles:

- _User_: The basic role that allows a person to open multiple participant related sections in the Data Space Portal, but basically cannot change anything
- _Key User_: The role allows creating and editing connectors for the user's organization
- _Admin_: Can additionally manage users, invite new users and deactivate existing users

{% hint style="info" %} We recommend that you encourage invitees to activate their accounts within the timebox for which the invitation link is enabled. For security reasons, the default timebox for the invitation link is 12 hours. We plan to increase this limit in the future. {% endhint %}

When clicking the invitation link, the user will be asked to set a password for their account and to set up two-factor authentication.

## Dashboard & Reporting

{% hint style="info" %} By default this functionality is disabled. If you would like to activate this section, please contact your relevant DSPortal contact or the sovity team. {% endhint %}

The Dashboard provides an overview over the current status of central Data Space Components as well as the organization's connectors.
