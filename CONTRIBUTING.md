### Submit a Pull Request

#### Consider contacting us first

We are a SaaS startup and thus to some capacity forced to be selective in what we do and what we choose to maintain.

Because of this, your best chance to contribute a feature would be through early close collaboration with us, with the opportunity for you to convince us of your vision, as only a good product vision alignment would ensure a feature survives.

Our goal remains a well-rounded production-ready industry-grade product with features fulfilling real-world demands and requirements. Thus, we have an incentive to take your pains and ideas seriously.
